# bdsmlr-scripts

Random scripts to do various things with BDSMLR due to the fact that they have no easily accessible API. Use at your own discretion.

## note

For scripts that output a file with URLs for download, I won't be implementing a pure python solution to download them. There's tons of alternatives, or even just some pure bash you can write to get the same result, faster and easier. Or just use something such as aria2c which has an easy to use argument to download an entire file's worth of URLs with ease.

## usage

Be sure to disable infinite scrolling on archive pages, otherwise this _will not work_.

1. Install requirements, `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run any of the scripts with your python 3.6+ interpreter.
